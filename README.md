This code was build with assitance with another developer

Make a new folder where you can easily access it 

open visual studio code
 
  open the folder that you made
    
    on the left hand side of the editor make a new file 
      
      name it "testing.asm"

        save the file to the folder you created

          copy and paste this code to the editor

            go to the extensions tab

              search for MASM/TASM and install the extention

                be sure that is the only extension that is enabled

                  right click on the code in the editor 

                    select "run ASM"

                      now a DOS VM should open on the right hand side that runs the code

Thank you for trying this code and pls suggest more things i can do to learn assembly
i think assembly is a neat language with excellen low level capabilities
I'm looking to incorperate this skill over to ESP32, Arduino, and PI but i have no clue where to start
